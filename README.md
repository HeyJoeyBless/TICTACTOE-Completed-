## 🕹️ Command Line Challenge#3

The **Command Line Game** was created to test out our interest level and willingness to try coding. This challenge was completed by a small team of 3 people, and we learned so much from our mentors and other classmates along the way.

At the beginning, code was new to all of us, and we struggled to understand concepts like dictionaries and loops. There were moments where it felt overwhelming, but the pain was worth it in the end. Now, we have this game to share with you all, and we're proud of what we've achieved! 🎮
